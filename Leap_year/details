Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
  1] on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder  
  2] except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder  
  3] unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart attached in the folder.

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 ÷ 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 ÷ 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 ÷ 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 ÷ 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 ÷ 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 ÷ 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

Example Input 1
2400
Example Output 1
Leap year
Example Input 2
1989
Example Output 2
Not leap year
